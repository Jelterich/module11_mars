#### 🌌 Mars Weather Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing Martian weather data to uncover seasonal patterns, temperature trends, and atmospheric pressure fluctuations. Additionally, it provides an estimate of the length of a Martian year based on the collected data. By leveraging web scraping and Python-based data analysis, the project offers valuable insights into Mars' unique climate system.
### 📁 Project Overview
## Part 1: Mars News Scraping
# Objective: Scrape the latest Mars news to understand recent discoveries and updates.
Method: Extract titles and preview texts from a Mars news website using web scraping tools.
## Part 2: Mars Weather Data Analysis
# Objective: Analyze Martian weather data (minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure) to identify seasonal trends.
Method: Scrape and process weather data from a table, visualize patterns, and calculate the Martian year length.
### 📂 Files in the Repository
## 1. Data Files
mars_weather_data.csv: Contains processed and cleaned Martian weather data, including temperature and pressure values.
## 2. Jupyter Notebooks
part_1_mars_news.ipynb: Notebook for scraping Mars news headlines and summaries.
part_2_mars_weather.ipynb: Notebook for scraping and analyzing weather data, with detailed visualizations.
## 3. README.md
Comprehensive project documentation.
### 🌟 Key Insights
## Minimum Temperature
Observation: The coldest months on Mars experience average minimum temperatures of approximately -83°C, while the warmest months average around -68°C.
Insight: Mars has extreme temperature variations caused by its thin atmosphere and long seasonal cycles.
## Atmospheric Pressure
Observation: Atmospheric pressure peaks at about 900 Pa during colder months and drops to approximately 740 Pa during warmer months.
Insight: These variations are linked to the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide from the Martian polar ice caps.
## Year Length
Observation: A Martian year is approximately 687 Earth days, as deduced from the repeating patterns in minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Insight: This aligns with Mars' orbital period around the Sun.
